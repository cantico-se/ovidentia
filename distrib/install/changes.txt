  the Developer's Guide for more information). 
- A user can through the "options" item in the "User" section select her 
  preferred stylesheet for her selected skin. 
- Implementation of the $ARTICLE function for topics and articles. 
- Implementation of the $FAQ function for FAQs and questions. 
- Users can now send mail to contributors to forums. 
- Administrators can configure Ovidentia so that visitors can not register at all,
  can register themselves, or can request to be registered. Ovidentia can be 
  configured to send a confirmation mail or not. 
- Files in file manager will be sorted alphabetically. 
- The parameter $babMaxRows in config.php is not used anymore. The maximum 
  number of rows displayed is now configurable from the forum creation interface. 
- When you write a comment on an article, you keep the visibility of the article
  for which you are writing a comment. And if you reply to a post to a forum, 
  you keep the visibility of the post to which you reply. 
- You can decide to not moderate comments on articles. 
- Archiving of articles. 
- All tables in the Ovidentia database are now prefixed with "bab" in order 
  to avoid name clashes with tables for Ovidentia add-ons. 
- Homogenization of the Ovidentia user interface 
- A small printer icon is added to each article. This allows to display the 
  article in a new browser window in a printable format. 
- The "Read more..." link will not be added to an article anymore if there is 
  no body for the article.

  content in this field and that there are no spaces in the content. 
- A message is sent to the moderator informing him when a comment is 
  submitted for an article in a topic with moderated comments. 
- Normalization of the names of the language files. The name of a 
  language file starts with the characters "lang-", followed by a two letter
  ISO 639 language code, eventually followed by a "-" character and a two letter
  ISO 3166 country code and always terminated with a ".xml" file extension.
  To be decided: these files will be valid xml files with utf-8 encoding. 
- Placeholders for additional language information for articles will be added 
  in the database.
