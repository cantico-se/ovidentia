OVIDENTIA 6.x
==============

Base Requirements
-----------------
In order to setup Ovidentia the folowing prerequisits are necessary.
- A Linux Box (http://www.linux.org), Mac OS X (http://developer.apple.com) or Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP (http://www.microsoft.com)
- Apache Web Server (http://www.apache.org) under Windows/Linux/OS X or
  Internet Information Server under Microsoft Windows (http://www.microsoft.com)
- PHP 4.0.3 (http://www.php.net)
- MySQL 3.23 database server (http://www.mysql.com)

The above doesn't mean that it doesn't work with other configurations, OS's, DB's etc,
but we only provide INSTALL instructions for the above configuration.
Set-up of these required packages is beyond the scope of this document
and if you are unsure you should check with each of the appropriate web
sites for further details.

Installing the Package
----------------------
Uncompress the package into the directory you want to use on your web
server, if you're unsure where that is, ask you system administrator.
1) Create a database called, for example, ovidentia:

    mysqladmin create ovidentia  
    
    It is recommended that you create a MySQL user that only has priveledges to to access this database and does not have "grant priveledges" rights. 
    For example, create the MySQL user "ovuser" with a secure password. This user should have no general MySQL rights. Only grant this user database level permissions to the ovidentia database. Do not grant this user "grant priveledges" database permissions. 

**** At this point, you may point your browser to http://yourdomain.com/install.php and skip steps 2 and 3 or continue manually ****

2) Now fill the databases with the tables in babinstall.sql file located in "install" folder:
    
    mysql ovidentia < babinstall.sql

3) Modify the config.php file with your site parameters
	
	$babDBHost = "localhost"; /* MySql database server */
	$babDBLogin = "ovuser"; /* MySql database login */
	$babDBPasswd = "securepass"; /* MySql database password */
	$babDBName ="ovidentia"; /* MySql database name */
	$babUrl = "http://yourdomain.com/"; /* url to access to your site */

4) After that, point your browser to:
    http://yourdomain.com/ and choose the menu "Login"
    
   Login with the following data at the prompt:
	User    : admin@admin.bab
	Password: 012345678
   
   You are logged as the administrator.
   ***Change administrator password by clicking the 'Options' menu in the 'User's
   section'.
   ***Choose 'sites' from the 'Administration section' and be sure to set your upload path. This is the server location where user uploaded files will be stored. It is recommended that this location not be within your webroot. For example: /home/upload 
   
5)  Be sure apache has group and ownership rights recursively from the site root.
    
    For UNIX/Linux installations: Recursively chmod 754 on the following:
    upload directory (declared in step 4)
    siteroot/images
    
    chmod 666 all languages files located in the "lang" folder.   
   
You may now manage your site by using the menu options located in the 'Administration section'
   
See the documentation for more information about administring Ovidentia.
