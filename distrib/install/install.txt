OVIDENTIA 4.0
==============

Base Requirements
-----------------
In order to setup Ovidentia the folowing prerequisits are necessary.
- A Linux Box (http://www.linux.org)  or Microsoft Windows NT/2000/XP (http://www.microsoft.com)
- Apache Web Server (http://www.apache.org) under Windows/Linux or
  Internet Information Server under Microsoft Windows (http://www.microsoft.com)
- PHP 4.0.3 (http://www.php.net)
- MySQL 3.23 database server (http://www.mysql.com)

The above doesn't mean that it doesn't work with other configurations, OS's, DB's etc,
but we only provide INSTALL instructions for the above configuration.
Set-up of these required packages is beyond the scope of this document
and if you are unsure you should check with each of the appropriate web
sites for further details.

Installing the Package
----------------------
Uncompress the package into the directory you want to use on your web
server, if you're unsure where that is, ask you system administrator.
1) Create a database called, for example, ovidentia:

    mysqladmin create ovidentia  

2) Now fill the databases with the tables in babinstall.sql file located in "install" folder:
    
    mysql ovidentia < babinstall.sql

3) Modify the config.php file with your site parameters
	
	$babDBHost = "localhost"; /* MySql database server */
	$babDBLogin = "root"; /* MySql database login */
	$babDBPasswd = ""; /* MySql database password */
	$babDBName ="ovidentia"; /* MySql database name */
	$babUrl = "http://yourdomain.com/"; /* url to access to your site */
	$babUploadPath = "/uploads-directory"; /* where to upload files */

    Be sure to chmod 777 "/uploads-directory" where users upload their files, if
    upload functionnality is enabled ( ATTENTION!!: this can have some
    security issues. Please consult your system Administrator )

   Also be sure to chmod 666 all languages files located in "lang" folder.

4) After that, point your browser to:
    http://yourdomain.com/ and choose the menu "Login"
    
   Login with the following data at the prompt:
	User    : admin@admin.bab
	Password: 012345678
   
   You are logged as administrator
   Before all, change administrator password by clicking 'Options' menu in 'User's Box'
   section.
   After this, you can manage your site by using menus in 'Administrator' section
   ( see documentation )
   and it's done ....
