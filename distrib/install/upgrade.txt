IMPORTANT: Always backup your database before any upgrade
and any resources used by your site ( like files, images, ... )!!!

To upgrade from previous Ovidentia versions:

Copy the files located in 'ovidentia' folder to your
old distribution.

Make sure to chmod 666 config.php to let ovidentia update the
version after upgrade.
( ATTENTION!!: this can have some security issues. 
Please consult your system Administrator )

Also you need to move base.php located in install folder to your web root
folder where there are config.php and index.php files

Otherwise you must do this by hand in config.php:

$babVersion="3.4"

point your browser to:

http://url-to-access-your-site/index.php?tg=version&idx=upgrade

Now, you can use the new version.
Don't forget to put the correct version in config.php if
Ovidentia can't.
