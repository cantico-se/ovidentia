IMPORTANT: Always backup your database before any upgrade
and any resources used by your site ( like files, images, ... )!!!

To upgrade from previous Ovidentia versions:

Copy the files located in ovidentia folder in your
old distribution.

Make sure to chmod 666 config.php to let ovidentia update
version after upgrade.
( ATTENTION!!: this can have some security issues. 
Please consult your system Administrator )

Otherwise you must make this by hand in config.php:

$babVersion="3.2"

point your browser to:

http://url-to-access-your-site/index.php?tg=version&idx=upgrade

Now, you can use the new version.
Don't forget to put the correct version in config.php if
Ovidentia can't.
